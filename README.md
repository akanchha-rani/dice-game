# 🎲 Dice Game

A simple yet interactive Dice Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game simulates rolling dice for two players and dynamically displays the winner based on random dice values.

This project is ideal for beginners to understand JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming in a fun way.

## 📖 Project Overview

The Dice Game randomly generates numbers between 1 and 6 for two players.
Each number corresponds to a dice image. The player with the higher number wins, and the result is displayed instantly on the screen.

The game logic runs:

Automatically on page refresh OR

On a button click (if implemented)
